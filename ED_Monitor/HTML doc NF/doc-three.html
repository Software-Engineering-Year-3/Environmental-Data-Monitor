    <h1>Hashing function Documentation</h1>
    <p>This documentation provides an overview of the code for the third issue:
		"Maintain high levels of system security and data protection".</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This issue is fundamental whitin an application that handles fragile data like personal user passwords to ensure	
		every user's data is protected throughly.</p>

    <h2>Key Components</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>SaltyPassword</strong>:This method implements the PBKDF and SHA512 algorithms to securely hash and salt passwords.</li>
        <li><strong>VerifyPassword</strong>:To verify if the input password matches the stored password, this method ensures the check
			is done safely and throughly</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>SaltyPassword Structure</h2>
    <ul>
		<li><strong>GenerateSalt</strong>:This section of the method generates a random salt that will be put at the start of 
			the password to make it unique, even in case of another user chooses the same one.</li>
		<li><strong>Apply PBKDF2 algorithm</strong>: Iterating over the input password the amount if times specified in the 'iterations' 
			variable, along side the salt generated previously and the algorithm itself, will generate the hashed password. </li>
		<li><strong>Combine salt and hash</strong>The salt and the hashed password are combined and stored into a hashByte array. </li>
		<li><strong>Storing hashed password safely</strong>: To store the safe password, which is currently stored in a single byte array, 
			it gets converted into a Base64 string, for better storage. </li>
	</ul>
	
	 <h3>VerifyPassword Structure</h3>
    <ul>
		<li><strong>Decode stored password</strong>:The method here decodes the stored hash, by converting it to a a single	
			byte array, from Base64.</li>
		<li><strong>Extract salt</strong>:The first 16 bytes of the password is the salt, which gets removed to only be left with the hashed password. </li>
		<li><strong>Extract hash</strong>From the remaining bytes, the hash is extracted, in order to be able to check it with the input password. </li>
		<li><strong>Hash the input password with the same salt</strong>: To ensure that the check to verify the two passwords match, they both get hashed with the same
			algorithm, salt and iterations number. </li>
		<li><strong>Compare passwords</strong>: After the hashing of both passwords they are compared, if they match, then the user is allowed to login.</li>
	</ul>
