    <h1>Verify data's accuracy documentation.</h1>
    <p>This documentation provides an overview of the code for the second issue:
		"Verify the accuracy and integrity of collected data".</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This issue is important for any users that are tasked with verifying if the data collected is 
	accurate and integral.</p>

    <h2>Key Components</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>ViewData.xaml</strong>:The ViewData.xaml file has been slighlt modified since the previous issue.
		It now implements a reusable QualityDataTemplate for ensuring consistent style across all the 
		ListViews across the code, it is easily understandable due to the consistent naming in variables and methods, 
		 to the separation in sections of the data types etc.</li>
        <li><strong>ViewData.xaml.cs</strong>:The xaml.cs file in th is case has been expanded to include
		methods to manually validate or flag data entries, as well as the log system to keep track of the changes  made to the data.</li>
		<li><strong>IDataService.cs</strong>:IDataService defines an interface for fetching data from the mock
		database implementation, it also allows for easier introduction of a real database. It only focuses on data retrival
		keeping the interface simple and clean.</li>
		<li><strong>IQualityReading.cs</strong>:This defines the interface for all quality reading models: it allows them to have
		a Status property and a Logs property to track whether the data is valid and, if it has been changed, what changes have been made.</li>
		<li><strong>DataLogs.cs</strong>:DataLogs.cs defines the structure of a singular log: it has a timestamp, a record of the action
		performed, by who and for what reason. This was thought to ensure consistency across all the logs for all the data types.</li>
		<li><strong>Enum.cs</strong>:This simply defines the DataStatus enumeration, it has been kept separate from the rest of 
		the code to ensure easier modification/expansion for the enumeration fields, if necessary.</li>
		<li><strong>Air/Water/WeatherService.cs</strong>:The service class for each data type shares the same code base, it has modified according
		to the data type it is interacting with, this helped ensure consistency, reusability and separation of concerns, since 
		for each data type there is a class dedicated.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>QualityDataTemplate Structure</h2>
    <ul>
		<li><strong>QualityDataTemplate</strong>:Creating a base template for displaying how each item is displayed in 
		the ListView, helpes ensure consistency and reusability.
		It defines the orientation of the stack layout, the padding and the fields to display, such as the SiteName, 
		the status etc. It also presents two buttons to perform the actions to validate or flag data. </li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>ValidateCommand Structure</h3>
    <ul>
		<li><strong>ValidateCommand</strong>:The function to validate the data first checks if the data is valid, if it is, then it does not proceed
		with the function; otherwise, it sets the status to valid and creates a log entry for the action perfomed.</li>		
	</ul>
	
	<h4>FlagCommand Structure</h4>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>FlagCommand</strong>:Similar enough to the previous function, this method flags a data entry when promped, 
		also creates a log of the action perfomed, along with all the fields specified previously.</li>		
	</ul>
